# Cisco SOHO Network Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a Small Office / Home Office (SOHO) network using Cisco technologies. It covers essential networking concepts commonly used in enterprise and service provider environments.

## Network Features
- VLAN configuration
- Inter-VLAN routing
- DHCP server configuration
- NAT (Network Address Translation)
- Static and dynamic routing
- IP addressing and subnetting

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco IOS CLI

## Topology
The network consists of routers, switches, and end devices designed to simulate a realistic SOHO environment.

## Learning Outcome
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with fundamental networking configurations, troubleshooting, and network segmentation, which are critical for cybersecurity and network engineering roles.
